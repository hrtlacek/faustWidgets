## Install
At the moment this is just a single py file that has to be imported as a module. just put it in your python search path.
This relies heavily on FAUSTPy. FAUSTPy was originally developed by Marc Joliet: https://github.com/marcecj/faust_python.
I ran into problems with this. I think it hassn't been updated in a while and FAUST changed a bit. You can find my fork of FAUSTPy here: https://github.com/hrtlacek/faust_python. I basically changed very little and got it to run again.
